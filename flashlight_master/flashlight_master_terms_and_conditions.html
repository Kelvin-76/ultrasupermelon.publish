                <p>
                    By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify
                    the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
                    way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                    to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
                    trade marks, copyright, database
                    rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to ultrasupermelon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ultrasupermelon is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
                    time and for any reason. We will never charge you for
                    the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Flashlight Master app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
                    to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
                    therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root
                    your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                    official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                    malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
                    phone’s security features and it could mean that the Flashlight Master app won’t work properly or at
                    all.

                    You should be aware that there are certain things that ultrasupermelon will not take responsibility
                    for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
                    connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
                    provider, but ultrasupermelon cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration
                    of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
                    accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
                    outside of your home territory (i.e.
                    region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                    which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
                    the bill payer for using the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the same lines, ultrasupermelon cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
                    i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t
                    turn it on to avail the Service, ultrasupermelon cannot
                    accept responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With respect to ultrasupermelon’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
                    it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct
                    at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
                    information to us so that we can make it available to you. ultrasupermelon accepts no liability for
                    any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
                    the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
                    requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
                    app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates
                    if you want to keep using the app. ultrasupermelon does not promise that it will always update the
                    app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on
                    your device. However, you promise
                    to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
                    the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless
                    we tell you otherwise, upon any
                    termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
                    using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
